Filters
- Use proportion of individuals rather than number
- Use 2 MAF criteria, one global and one per pop
- Put MAF filters before choosing how many SNPs per loci
- Improve documentation of script file

Global
- Improve scripts formatting
    - stacks_4_populations.sh
- Rename individuals with pop_ind.fastq rather than lane_barcode.fastq
    - Take 1 info file for all the individuals, it should contain:
        - Lane filename, individual name, population name (and number?), barcode
        - If individual was resequenced, include '.duplicate' in its name 
        - Make sure the rest of the name is IDENTICAL
* Add step to merge resequenced individuals (fastq_combine_files.sh)

Process radtags
- From info file, create one barcode file per line
- Run the files with the most barcodes first (= faster)
- Use the -D option to filter recursively on kmer lengths
- When finished, rename log file with date and barcode length
    
Documentation
- Add know-how section
    - Testing different trim lengths to keep more reads
    - Testing different parameters for STACKS scripts
    - Filtering
- Improve documentation of scripts

Maybe
- VCFtools (see what the students need)
