Process radtags
- For each lane, separate the barcodes of different lengths (done)
- Run the files with the most barcodes first (= faster)
- Use the -D option to filter recursively on kmer lengths
- When finished, rename log file with date and barcode length
    
Global
- Add step to merge resequenced individuals (fastq_combine_files.sh)
- Keep log and error log of all scripts (use tee)

Filters
- For Het and Fis filters, only the SNPs for 1 population are outputed to the
  filtered file. Should be the whole locus.
