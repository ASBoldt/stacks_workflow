Rename samples
==============

To rename and copy the samples, run:
------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

 ./00-scripts/03_rename_samples.sh

Join samples that should go together
 - Go to ``04-all_samples`` and join the .fq files that should go together with the ``cat`` command
 - Remove partial .fq files that have been joined
 - Remove individuals with too few sequences if needed (optional)
